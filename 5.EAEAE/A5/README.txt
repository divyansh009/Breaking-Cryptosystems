To run the entire code using makefile (it might take 2-5 mins to run all codes because it also includes plaintext and ciphertext generation) :
* Open the terminal in linux OS at the location where the makefile is located. 
Then type the following command:
make attack

Steps to run only that code where actual decryption works and A,E and password is computed: 
* Run the command 'python3 answer.py' It will give the values of E, A and decrypted password.
